  =aRMSD= is an open toolbox for the structural comparison of two
  constitutionally identical molecules.  The data are read from common
  file formats (e.g., =*.xyz=, =*.pdb=, etc.) by default, or by
  assistance of =openbabel=.[fn:babel] The results may be accessed
  interactively as 3D rendering with =vtk=[fn:vtk] and exported.  The
  development started with Arne Wagner during his PhD
  thesis in the Himmel group (University of Heidelberg) and
  made available on https://github.com/armsd/aRMSD.

  Contrasting to said original branch, /this/ fork develops =aRMSD=
  under Linux (Debian 10 / Buster, currently testing / Sid), since it
  was used side-by-side with other programs already deployed
  successfully in Linux.  Specific to Linux: I liked to have a Python
  script resolving the dependencies of =aRMSD= instead of a somewhat
  manual download, and installation anticipated for Windows.  Other
  than this, changes made within this fork, however, should work
  equally in other operating systems.

* What may aRMSD do for you -- an appetizer

  As shown in the figure below, =aRMSD= may be used to align the
  models (a) and reorder the atom order by the Hungarian
  algorithm (b). Subsequently, the superposition is optimized by
  minimization of the RMSD according to the Kabsch algorithm.

  [[./aRMSD-aspirinateSteps.png]]

  In a newly designed representation (c), the differences between the
  two models may be accessed visually: atoms drawn with larger
  diameter indicate a larger /relative/ contribution to the final RMSD
  determined for the complete model.  The color scaling, corresponding
  to the scale at the side, corresponds to the /absolute/ difference
  -- in Angstroms -- of said atom for both models in the optimized
  superposition.

  In addition, the program compares the corresponding bond lengths of
  model and reference indicates either by green or red color encoding
  if the one by the model is shorter, or lengthier than the
  corresponding bond in the reference.  Not shown here, but =aRMSD=
  allows the interactive readout of the differences found for selected
  bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles, too.

  Equally, the program offers you an interactive 3D rendering of model
  and reference with the optimized superposition (d).  This "best fit"
  determined may be saved in =*.xyz= files.

  On an operational system including =matplotlib=, =aRMSD= may
  complement the scrutiny by computing and plotting selected
  statistics.  The scaling may be altered by the user, equally in
  charge to select the file format of export (=*.png=; =*.ps=, =*.eps=
  =*.pdf=, =*.svg=; =*.tkiz=).

  Besides the results of the Kabsch test, supplementary similarity
  figures of merit like the cosine similarity or the GARD values may
  be stored permanently in plain ASCII (=aRMSD_logfile.out=).

  Altogether with a few test data (sub-directory =examples=), an
  illustrated primer in sub-directory =docs= will guide you through
  setting-up the program and detail out how to perform a basic analysis. 

* Where stands aRMSD, relatively to other programs?

  =aRMSD= emerges from the pair-wise comparison of (crystallographic,
  but not limited to this) models with significant user-interaction.
  This offers you multiple levels to check and adjust the progress of
  the analysis.  As such, a batch-wise comparison of models is not
  foreseen.

  Note, however, that an automate, batch-wise scrutiny of two model
  data may yield wrong results.  One potential pitfall is how the
  model information is handled prior to the refinement of the
  structure alignment, where =aRMSD= uses the Hungarian algorithm.  To
  quote Kildgaard:[fn:Kildgaard]

  #+LATEX:  \begin{quote}
  "The RMSD can be minimized by translating and rotating one set of
  coordinates (the other is held fixed) because the molecules are
  invariant under these operations. This will lead to the two
  molecules being superimposed but can also lead to a false RMSD value
  if the atoms are not ordered identically."
  #+LATEX:  \end{quote}

  Independent from this problem, the conventional RMSD optimization
  accounts only for /atom connectivity/, neglecting /bond order/.  As
  demonstrated (and illustrated) by Temeslo[fn:Temeslo], this may
  yield to results questionable from a chemists point of view.

  
  
* History & Credits

  =aRMSD= was developed in Windows by Arne Wagner during his PhD
  thesis in the Himmel group (University of Heidelberg, Germany).  It
  is described briefly in his PhD thesis submitted in
  2015.[fn:Wagner-PhD] The program was presented in further detail in

  was on April 5, 2017.  My subsequent work on =aRMSD= is based on this release.
