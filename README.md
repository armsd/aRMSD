**Note 1:**  This fork targets a deployment of aRMSD under Linux without
assistance by PyInstaller and calling the program from the CLI (i.e.,
option a) of the original description).  Intended for Linux Debian 9
(sid buster), the installation of the packages allowing aRMSD to work is
partially automated by script [./debcollector_aRMSD.py].  It might be
that changes of this fork equally work under other operational systems
(closer / farter relatives like Xubuntu 18.04 LTS / Fedora), too.

**Note 2:**  Familiarizing with the code takes some time.  Which is why
a rather conservative approach changing the program seems personally
more comfortable for me.  However, an initial *illustrated primer about
how to use* this program was written.  Altogether with some test data in
[./examples], for further information, see [./docs/aRSMD-primer.org].

An open toolbox for structural comparison between two molecules with
various capabilities to explore different aspects of structural
similarity and diversity. Using data from common file formats the
minimum RMSD is found by combining the functionalities of the Hungarian
and the Kabsch algorithm. Crystallographic data provided from cif files
is fully supported and the results can be rendered with the help of the
[vtk] (http://www.vtk.org/) package.

# News & Updates
This page is currently under construction and more files will be added
from day to day. So the best way to keep track of all changes and the
ongoing development process is by inspecting the
[changelog] (./CHANGELOG.md). Please note that *aRMSD* was developed
under Windows and is therefore not tested under other operating systems.
Any feedback concerning the execution or PyInstaller compilation on
Linux / Mac / ... is greatly appreciated.

The official publication was published recently and can be found under
(DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00516). If you use *aRMSD* in your work, please

# Installation
*aRMSD* can be [installed] (./INSTALLATION.md) in two ways, either via
pip (in this case it will be used as a Python module or Python
application) or you can download the source code and compile it into a
single standalone executable. In any case some packages are required
which are listed below:

    * Python 2.7 or 3.6
    * numpy
    * vtk
    * matplotlib
    * PyQt4
    * uncertainties

optional:

    * Cython [performance improvements]
    * openbabel / pybel [additional file formats]

In order adjust the source code by yourself, always make sure to have
the required Python packages installed and download the latest version
of the master branch. Whenever possible it is recommended to add and
update packages using pre-compiled Python
[wheels] (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) suited for your
operating system which can be installed via pip. If you add features or
wish to have an idea implemented or a bug fixed, contact me or make a
[request] (https://github.com/armsd/aRMSD/issues).

**a) Usage as Python application:**

- The easiest way to use *aRMSD*.

Simply clone the project or download the zip file from GitHub, navigate
to the armsd folder and run aRMSD.py, e.g. from command line

```bash
python aRMSD.py
```

**b) Usage as Python module:**

- This will install *aRMSD* as a Python module that can be imported and
used in other applications. This allows for both the most extensive
utilization of the code and provides the possibility to keep an eye on 
the ongoing development via pip.

Install the program by typing

```bash
pip [to be added]
```

in your command line.

**c) Executable compiled with PyInstaller:**

- Produces a single file which can be copied alongside the
*settings.cfg* and the *xsf folder* to different machines with the same
architecture. Once the program has been compiled, this is probably the
easiest way to use *aRMSD* - especially for users that are unfamiliar
with Python. 

First ensure that you have the latest version of
[PyInstaller] (http://www.pyinstaller.org/) or install it with pip.

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Download the current master branch of *aRMSD*, extract the files and
navigate to the main folder. Run the compilation script in an
interactive Python shell or from command line by typing

```bash
python compile_aRMSD.py
```

This will create a single executable file in the armsd folder and should
work for all operating systems. Temporary files will be created during
this process (the compilation will take around 30 min, depending on the
machine) and deleted after the executable is created. Optional arguments
can be given to make use of [Cython] (http://cython.org/) and
[openbabel] (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page). Note that
Cython C compiler should be specified if several options are available.

```bash
python compile_aRMSD.py --use_cython=True --cython_compiler=msvc --use_openbabel=True --overwrite=True
```

If you are using Python 3.6, there is a bug in the PyInstaller entry
script and typing pyinstaller in a shell will not start a correct
process. To fix this, go in the Python installation folder and edit the
pyinstaller-script.py file: add quotes around the path in the first
program line (e.g. "c:\program files\python36\python.exe")) 

# Documentation and Tutorial
To use the program, start the executable (if you are running aRMSD for
the first time it is recommended to start the executable from command
line to catch potential error messages) or run the application in a
Python shell. Copy the example files to your current working directory
and follow the instructions on screen. More information will be added in
the near future.
