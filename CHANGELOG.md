Version     0.9.8 (3 December 2018, development)
------------------------
** Improvements **
          - The illustrated primer basically was reorganized:  It aims to retain
            the results about installing the program in Windows (credit to Arne
            Wagner) as much as possible, includes a section about the install in
            Debian 10 and Xubuntu 18.04.1, and details out a basic analysis.
**Bugfixes**
          - Addressing formatting issues in alog.py and the permanent output
            generated by alog.py
          - Updating the information that debcollector-aRMSD.py facilitating the
            fetch and installation of dependices of aRMSD equally works under
            Debian 9 (Sid/buster), as well as Xubuntu 18.04 LTS (point release
            18.04.1 was tested successfully).

Version     0.9.7 (26 November 2018, development)
------------------------

**Improvements**
          - Reorder of the presentation of the similarity results (Kabsch, 
            cosine, GARD).  Especially keeping the GARD data together and close
            to their corresponding literature reference.

**Bugfixes**
          - Heading tabulators should no longer be used in the permanent record,
            aRMSD_logfile.out.  The remaining internal ones do not disturb the
            self-imposed line limit (80 chars/line) if interpreted as either
            four, or eight chars.

Version     0.9.5 (24 October 2018, development)
------------------------

**Improvements**

         - deployment of aRMSD under Linux Debian 9 (buster/sid) is facilitated
           by a script collecting and installing the *.deb dependicies
         - provision of an initial, illustrated primer about the progam
           altogether with additional test data BZAMID-A / BZAMID-B both in 
           *.xyz and *.pdb

**Bugfixes**

         - aRMSD's color scheme to display of model and reference compared with
           each other prior and after the Kabsch test now is the same
         - addition of a time stamp about the analysis (log file)
         - gently change of aRMSD's log line limit to 80 chars now allows a
           smoother display in either terminal / text editor, or word processor
