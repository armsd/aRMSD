Installation details
------------------------

aRMSD uses several packages that are actively developed and continuously
change in the future. Therefore keeping track of changes in other
packages is important to ensure that aRMSD will continue to work with
newer package versions. The program was developed and tested with the
following versions of the directly used third party packages. 

**Module versions**

         - numpy 1.11.1 / 1.12
         - matplotlib 1.5.3 / 2.0
         - vtk 6.2.0 / 7.0
         - future 0.16.0
         - uncertainties 3.0.1
         - cython 0.25.2
         - openbabel 2.4.1

Due to changes from vtk 5 to 6, aRMSD does not support older vtk version
than 6.2 and a backwards compatibility to the older vtk 5 engine is not
planned (unless it is frequently requested).

**Compilation arguments**

The following arguments can be passed to the installation script and
specify the usage of Cython and openbabel in the compilation. All
arguments are optional and if none are given neither Cython nor
openbabel will be used. The specification of the C compiler may not be
needed if your defaults are properly set, however setting it explicitly
should ensure a successful installation.

         - --use_cython (True / False)
         - --cython_compiler (any valid C compiler used by Cython,
             e.g. msvc)
         - --use_openbabel (True / False)
         - --overwrite (True / False)

During the installation, the existence of an openbabel hook file in the
PyInstaller hook path is checked. If no hook exists, a respective file
will be created. In case of an existing hook, the file can be
overwritten if the --overwrite variable is set to True.


Future developments
------------------------

Several new features and improvements are planned which will hopefully
be continuously added in the future, some of which are:

         - Better 3D rendering for large molecules (>2000 atoms)
         - Reduction of matching errors through improved cost matrices
         - Improvements for 2D and 3D plots (mostly text annotation)
         - Better formatting for the output and improved
           [Blender] (http://www.blender.org) interface
         - Structural interpolation in internal coordinates
         - Better support of substructures

Any ideas are always welcome and requested features will be added if
time allows it.
