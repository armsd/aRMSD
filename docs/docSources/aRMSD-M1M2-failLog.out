*** Log file about the superposition of structures ***

    "Model"...                                                            M1.xyz
    "Reference"...                                                        M2.xyz

* Consistency establishment between the structures:

  The basic approach is to subsequently remove hydrogen atoms
  until the same number of atoms is found in both molecules.
  If the number of atoms is identical and the atom types belong
  to the same group in the periodic table, the molecules are
  considered as consistent.

    No disorder in the structures was found.                

    Initial number of atoms in "Model"...                   	20  (7 H atoms)
    Initial number of atoms in "Reference"...               	20  (7 H atoms)
    
    Consistency between the structures was established:
    The number of atoms in "Model"...                       	20  (7 H atoms)
    The number of atoms in "Reference"...                   	20  (7 H atoms)
    
    No further modifications were performed.           
    
    Final global atom count (number of hydrogens retained)...	20  (7 H atoms)

* Transformation of the molecules into "Standard Orientation":
  1. The center of mass was shifted to the Cartesian origin.
  2. The moment of inertia tensor was constructed, diagonalized
     and the eigenvectors rotated on the x, y and z axes.
