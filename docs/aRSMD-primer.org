* Generalities

  Development of the program aRMSD started by Arne Wagner during his
  PhD in the Himmel group (University of Heidelberg).  aRMSD was
  presented both in his PhD thesis () and in a publication ().

  The aim of this fork is to use aRMSD in a "portable mode" on a
  computer running Linux Debian (sid/buster, 64 bit) from the CLI
  provided by python -- without assistance of PyInstaller.

  aRMSD allows a pre-alignment of a test relative to a reference
  motif and subsequent refinement of this initial superposition 
  according to the Kabsch test. Accepted file formats of the model
  data to test include *.xyz and *.pdb, and other formats openbabel
  may read and convert into them. aRMSDâ€™s focus is the pairwise
  comparison of two model data; if you intend to compare several model
  data batch-wise, you may be better served with alternatives presented
  in section (TODO).

* System at dispostion

  The system at disposition runs Linux Debian (sid/buster, 64 bit).
  Installed packages deemed to be relevant in successful deployment of
  aRMSD are, as readout with the synaptic package manager by Debian:
  + python (version 2.7.15+) and python3 (version 3.6.6)
    
  + cython (version 0.28.4-1)

  + openbabel, libopenbabel5, python-openbabel (all in version 2.4.1+dfsg-2)

  + python-matplotlib, python-matplotlib-data, python3-matplotlib (all
    in version 2.2.2-4+b1)

  + python-uncertainties, python3-uncertainties (all in version 2.4.4-1)

  + libvtk6.3, libvtk6.3-qt, python-vtk6 (all in version 6.3.0+dfsg2-2+b3);
    libvtk7.1, libvtk7.1-qt, python3-vtk7, vtk7 (all in version 7.1.1+dfsg1-5).
