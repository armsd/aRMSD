* Generalities

  Development of the program aRMSD started by Arne Wagner during his
  PhD in the Himmel group (University of Heidelberg).  aRMSD was
  presented both in his PhD thesis () and in a publication ().

  The aim of this fork is to use aRMSD in a "portable mode" on a
  computer running Linux Debian (sid/buster, 64 bit) from the CLI
  provided by python -- without assistance of PyInstaller.
