"""
aRMSD
==================================
aRMSD is a Python module/program that allows for a fast and comprehensive
analysis of molecular structures parsed from different files. Unique features
are a support of crystallographic data, error propagation and specific types
of graphical representations.

Key features:
* Parses data from various file formats
* Establishes consistency and matches coordinate sequences of two molecules
* Aligns two molecular structures based on the Kabsch algorithm
* Supports different weighting functions for the superposition
* Supports error propagation for experimental structures
* Generates different visualization types of the superposition results
* Writes outfiles that can be passed to other programs

Dependencies:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* vtk
* uncertainties
* [Cython]
* [openbabel/pybel]

*** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
It is highly recommended to install all dependencies directly from
python wheels prior to the installation of aRMSD (especially numpy and vtk)

* Recent changes are listed in CHANGELOG.md
